Back when Lotus Notes was still wearing short pants, let's say before about 1995 or 19
96, the issue of version control would never have come up in conversation around theN
otes development team's water cooler. In fact, back then, most Notes developers probab
ly wouldn't have even known what version control, revision control, source code contro
 1or whatever you want to call it, even was.
Many people who found themselves building and maintaining Lotus Notes applications had
 not come fromatraditional software engineering background, having started out asa
â€œpower user" and developed their skills in sync with the evolution of Notes as an appl
ication platform. Admittedly,Iwent to school for computer sciencealong time ago (c
lass of 19841) but even back then, it was drilled into me to use Sccs and Make for ver
sion control and build management.
